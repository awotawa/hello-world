learning github basics
Hi everyone, I'm a fresh graduate with a Mechanical engineering diploma with specialization in Mechatronics. Been working for a year as a 3D printing expert and towards the end also as a sales engineer. Facing lots of dissatisfaction and frustration, I decided to change career path to where I would be able to have control over the quality of the products/services that I deliver ; that's why I'm learning to code at Le Wagon :D
